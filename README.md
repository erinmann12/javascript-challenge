# javascript-challenge

For this project, we were tasked by the fictional company ALIENS-R-REAL to write code for their database of eye-witness reports of extra-terrestrial life. The code needed to create a table dynamically based upon the dataset. Users should also be able to filter the table data to search for specific values. 

First we created a basic HTML web page to display the data. Next, we used the UFO dataset that was in the form of an array of JavaScript objects to write code that appends a table to the web page and adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. 

In the final step, we used a date form in the HTML document to write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

The languages we used for the project were JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js.
